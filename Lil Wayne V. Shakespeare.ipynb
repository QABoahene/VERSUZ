      "[Chorus] I don't know who you are anymore Talkin' to the man in her mirror That been fuckin' with these bitches And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit But, you don't even call anymore And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone? [Post-Chorus] And, we don't even talk anymore Ain't got no time to spare So who are we to trust anyone? I'm tryna be sincere When we both know it ain't right She hate that we can get loose But I can never hang tight But, we don't even make love anymore Actin' like our phone got our attention Though we watchin' television, and it's painless We act like we strangers I just don't know who we are anymore, damn I'm not supposed to be here 'Cause love don't live here But I'm here, and she here She tell me stay all night She just want a refill And then she want to start fights 'Bout \"What about how she feel?\" She tell me I'm a cheap thrill I know she don't mean that She think I feed her lies But I don't get no feedback As she watch me pack \"Baby where my keys at?\" [Chorus] I don't know who you are anymore Talkin' to the man in her mirror That been fuckin' with these bitches And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit But you don't even call anymore And you don't even care So who am I to love anyone? [Post-Chorus] And, we don't even talk anymore Ain't got no time to spare So who are we to trust anyone? [Verse 2] I was talkin' to myself the other day My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, \"Pray\" She say, \"I need a day\", I said, \"I need a bae\" She said, \"Believe in faith Ma, they love me either way\" Hold up, wait Let me set my alarm You say \"Don't sweat your alarm\" And now the pressure is on So now there's sweat in my palm But her reception ain't warm So my deception performs And then that silence is awkward Like am I deaf or alone? I got a jet in the morn' And she upset and I'm calm And when a woman is scorned Is when your welcome is worn And now her temperature's showin' And I just weather her storm And she expect me to stay I be like, \"Let go my arm!\" [Chorus] I don't know who you are anymore​ Talking to the man in her mirror I've been fuckin' with these bitches And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit And she say, you don't even call anymore And you don't even care So who am I to love anyone? [Outro] She say we don't make love anymore Actin' like our phone got our attention Though we watchin' television, now it's painless We actin' like strangers Like we don't know who we are anymore Perfect strangers\n",
